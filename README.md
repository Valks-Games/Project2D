Playing around with biome generation, might become something more, who knows.

Contact me on Discord `valk#9904` for any questions you may have.

## Roadmap
- [ ] expand biome table to also include a 3rd parameter "elevation" / add mountain and hilly biomes (required for rivers / other bodies of water)
- [ ] figure out how to get more control over the shape and size of each biome
- [ ] chunks generate when camera moves around
- [ ] oceans / lakes / rivers
- [ ] biome specific trees / rocks
