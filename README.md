Playing around with biome generation, might become something more, who knows.

## Roadmap
- [ ] expand biome table to also include a 3rd parameter "elevation" / add mountain and hilly biomes
- [ ] figure out how to get more control over the shape and size of each biome
- [ ] chunk generation
- [ ] rivers
- [ ] oceans
- [ ] biome specific trees / rocks
- [ ] name the tiles in the tilemap and access them by name in script for human readability
